### Overview

**Hisaab** is a React-based web application which I created as a website for my flatmates to manage and log our joint expenses, the app allows users to add, track, and manage entries for items purchased, and calculates how much each person owes. The app also has charts windows and activities pane.

### Usage

1. **Login/Register**:
    - The app starts with a login/register screen. Users can either log in or register as a new user using the provided registration code.

2. **Adding Entries**:
    - Once logged in, users can add new entries by clicking the `New Entry` button on the navbar. Users need to input details like items, price, notes, and who owes the amount.
If needed user can make backdated entries, as well.

3. **Viewing and Editing Entries**:
    - Entries are listed on the board. Users can click their own entries to edit them. Non-editable entries can be clicked to view details in a pop-up.

4. **Summary**:
    - The summary section shows the total amount spent and the amount owed by the user. Users can click on button in the summary pane to see a detailed breakdown of amounts owed to each person, charts to show the spending trends over the month, how much each person spent, and activities of people with regards to making and updating entries.

### APIs Used

The app uses Axios for API handling and backend communication. The base URL is set to:

```javascript
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://hisaab-ashy.vercel.app/",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

Axios interceptors are used to attach the authorization token to requests:

```javascript
axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
    if (token && !config.url.includes("/login")) {
      config.headers["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);
```

### Components
